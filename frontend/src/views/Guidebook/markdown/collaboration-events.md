Collaboration events are events put together by Mintbean in association with another organization or individual. These events are custom-created for the collaboration.

We are open to collaboration with the following types of entities:

* Enterprises, startups, and businesses
* Government bodies & public sector
* Non-profits and charities
* Educators and educational institutions
* Thought leaders and influencers
* Open source projects
* Tech-related communities

## How can I attend a collaboration event?

Keep an eye on our LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and Discord channel. Collaboration events are announced there and, very often, on our collaboration partners' feeds.
