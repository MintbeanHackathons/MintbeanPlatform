  Winning is optional. Knowledge is the real prize. Only worry about scoring if you're looking to challenge yourself.

## What is the prize for CareerHack Winners and Division Champions?

Division champions are prominently showcased as a group on social media.

The Winner gets prominently showcased by themselves on social media and gets invited to a special "Winner's Room" on Discord.

Both Winners and Division Champions are showcased on Mintbean's website, where everyone (including potential employers!) can see their achievements (Coming Soon!!).

## How are CareerHack Winners picked?

CareerHack scoring is based on a simple and straightforward tournament system that is similar to round-robin:

* Step 1: Projects are grouped into divisions in the Code Review phase of the Hackathon. 
* Step 2: Each division votes for the best project in 2 separate categories:
  1. **Project with the best look, feel, and featureset (Aesthetics)**
  2. **Participant who gave the most useful code review feedback**.
* Step 3: A judge selects the Hackathon Winner from amongst the division champions based on the above 2 criteria PLUS **Code Quality**.

What this means is that Code Quality is extremely critical for anyone who is looking to win the Hackathon.

There are multiple Division Champions per Hackathon. There can only be a single Winner for any given Hackathon.

## How to Vote

At the end of the Hackathon, you will be sending a direct message with your vote to Monarch Wadia during the event. Please use the following template.

## Voting Criteria Explained

### 1. Project with the Best Look-and-Feel (Aesthetics)

The question you're asking yourself for this category is: "Is this project the most featureful project? Is it beautiful and aesthetically pleasing? Does it have an effective UX/UI?

#### How to maximize your chances of winning in this category

The best way to get points for aesthetic appeal is to deploy your project to a server.

Suggested methods:

* Codepen
* Repl.it
* Heroku
* Github Pages

If the above are not options for you, you can capture your screen and attach a video with your final push. (including with your cellphone camera, no big deal). 

As a last resort, screenshotsMy name is Monarch Wadia uploaded in your final push will do.

### 2. Participant with Most Useful Code Review

The question you're asking yourself for this category is: "Did I receive useful feedback from the author of this project?"

#### What are useful Code Review comments?

Code review means leaving constructive comments on other people's code.

"Useful" means things like:
1. Valid points about the author's architecture.
1. Constructive criticism on the author's code on actual tangible things (not spacing issues, for example).
1. Pointing out logical errors in the author's code (but being nice about it).
1. Suggestions for better ways to do things.
1. Last but not least: common courtesy and being nice. Don't be a jerk.

The following things are NOT useful. No points are awarded for things like:
1. Nitpicks on non-functional aspects like syntax, indentation, unused variables, etc.
1. Positive comments like "Awesome!" or "Great job!" or "I like this!"
1. Harrassing, abusive or sarcastic comments (these could disqualify you and possibly get you banned)
1. Other comments that are not useful to the author.

## (JUDGE ONLY) Project with the Best Code Quality

You do NOT have to vote for this category.

The judge will choose a winner partially based on this category. 

Is this project's code bug-free, easily understandable, and flexible?

#### How do I get points on this category?

This is the hardest category to vote for.

Code quality is something that has an element of subjectivity to it, but is also an objectively recognizable feature of software. It is a subject of much debate.

The best code is bug-free, can be understood very easily, and is flexible enough to change without breaking things. It also may follow common best practices, and follows idiomatic patterns specific to the language it is written in.

# You don't have to finish OR win

Remember: learning is the main reward here. Competing is fun and encouraged, but optional. Even finishing your project is not necessarily important! The point here is to learn.

If you'd like to seriously compete, though, then keep in mind that more complex and interesting applications will stand a better chance of winning.
