## About CareerHack Hackathons

CareerHack Hackathons are short-format hackathons are 4-hour "bursts". These are designed to encourage daily coding practice. The goal in short-format hackathons is to learn to build new types of projects every week.

* Solo, structured, semi-competitive.
* 12pm-4pm, Mondays and Wednesdays (excluding Ontario statutory holidays).
* Everybody works on the same hackathon challenge.
* Often (but not always) followed by a Hireside Chat.

## How to sign up for an event

Please go to [Eventbrite] to sign up for an upcoming event.

## Who are these hackathons for?

This hackathon is for developers of all levels who have some experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Winning is optional

CareerHack Hackathons are a safe space where learning takes place. They are designed to be as beginner-friendly and low-pressure as possible. Many participants don't even try to win at CareerHack, and instead focus on learning new things. Making mistakes is encouraged as a natural part of the learning process.

Toxic, aggressive, over-competitive, and hostile behaviours unsuitable for a workplace/educational environment are met with warnings, kicks and permabans.
