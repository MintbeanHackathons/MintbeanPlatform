### Leaving deployment links

In order to assess aesthetic quality, we require some kind of way to see what your app looks like.

Choose ONE of the following methods:

1. Deploy your project to the web. Leave the deployed URL in your Pull Request's 1st comment.
1. Take a video of your project and upload it to the web. Leave the video's URL in your Pull Request's 1st comment.

1. Take 3 to 10 photos of your project. Coppy-paste OR drag/drop the images into your Pull Request's 1st comment.

You're done!
