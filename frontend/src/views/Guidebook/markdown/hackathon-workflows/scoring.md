# Scoring

* 33% Code Quality
* 33% Aesthetic Appeal
* 33% Code Review

## How to get points for Code Quality

1. Write code that is bug-free
1. Write code that other people can easily understand
1. Write code that other people can change without breaking things
1. Write code that is in-line with current best practices

## How to get points for Aesthetic Appeal

The best way to get points for aesthetic appeal is to deploy your project to a server.

Suggested methods:

* Codepen
* Repl.it
* Heroku
* Github Pages

If the above are not options for you, you can capture your screen and attach a video with your final push. (including with your cellphone camera, no big deal). 

As a last resort, screenshots uploaded in your final push will do.

## How to get points for Code Review

Code review means leaving constructive comments on other people's code.

Good code reviews are useful for the author of the project.

Your points will be awarded based on how useful you were to other authors of projects.

"Useful" means things like:
1. Valid points about the author's architecture.
1. Constructive criticism on the author's code on actual tangible things (not spacing issues, for example).
1. Pointing out logical errors in the author's code (but being nice about it).
1. Suggestions for better ways to do things.
1. Last but not least: common courtesy and being nice. Don't be a jerk.

The following things are NOT useful. No points are awarded for things like:
1. Nitpicks on non-functional aspects like syntax, indentation, unused variables, etc.
1. Positive comments like "Awesome!" or "Great job!" or "I like this!"
1. Harrassing, abusive or sarcastic comments (these could disqualify you and possibly get you banned)
1. Other comments that are not useful to the author.


# You don't have to finish OR win

Remember: learning is the main reward here. Competing is fun and encouraged, but optional. Even finishing your project is not necessarily important! The point here is to learn.

If you'd like to seriously compete, though, then keep in mind that more complex and interesting applications will stand a better chance of winning.
