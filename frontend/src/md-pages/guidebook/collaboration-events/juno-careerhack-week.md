## What is CareerHack Week?

It's a virtual hackathon!

CareerHack Week is a week-long, online-only hackathon that exposes you to industry best practices and standard ways of building software. 

## What will I learn?

CareerHack Week gives you a sneak peek into the real world of software development. It is designed to help you:

* Learn the skills you need to succeed in your first job.
* Network with highly-experienced industry professionals.
* Build a project using real-life best practices.
* Get feedback and insights into your skillset.

## How does it work?

We kick-start CareerHack Week on the first day with a fun 4-hour Orientation Hackathon (OrientationHack, which is modelled after [CareerHack Hackathons](/guidebook/careerhack-hackathons)).

OrientationHack is designed to introduce you to the problem set, understand your skillset, and help us build more balanced groups for the main hackathon. After OrientationHack, groups are assigned, and the week-long hackathon begins.

You can expect to commit a minimum of 3 hours per day coding or more during CareerHack Week.

Throughout the week, CareerHack Week advisors will be available during office hours. The  CareerHack Week advisor, who will be responsible for guiding you through the hackathon and help you get unstuck where needed. 

The last day is a half day. Winners get announced on the same day.

## What does the winner get?

The winner gets their project featured on social media, and (of course!) can feature the victory on their resume, LinkedIn and portfolio
