## About weekend workshops

Weekend workshops are 3-day workshop events that start each Friday and end on Sunday. These are designed to encourage the building of more involved projects at a time that is convenient for all involved. 

Weekend workshops aim to fully exercise participants' software development abilities while building real-life software that will be released to the general public.

* Solo or group-based, informal, collaborative.
* Timings informal, Friday to Sunday, regardless of holidays.
* Each participant is assigned a real-world ticket, task or project.

## How weekend workshops benefit you

Weekend workshops can be very beneficial to your career because they:
* Get you public commits on Github
* Earn you open source contributions that you can cite on your profile
* Let you learn from building software in a group setting
