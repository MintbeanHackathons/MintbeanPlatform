**Important: Do NOT clone the repo directly. This may cause issues that could delay you during the submission phase of the project. Instead, fork the main repo first, then clone your own forked copy of the repo**

1. Click on the repo indicated in Discord as today's challenge. (These usually start with the day's date. For example: [2020-04-27-conways-game-easier-with-examples](https://github.com/MintbeanHackathons/2020-04-27-conways-game-easier-with-examples))
1. Click on the "Fork" button on the top-right of the UI. If given a choice in a popup window, choose your own Github profile.
1. The repo will begin forking. Click "refresh" after a few seconds, or until the repo has finished forking.
1. Now, clone your fork using Github.
