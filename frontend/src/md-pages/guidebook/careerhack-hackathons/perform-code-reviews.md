# Performing code reviews

[Mintbean Guidebook](/guidebook) > [CareerHack Hackathons](/guidebook/careerhack-hackathons) > Performing code reviews

At the end of the Coding section, you will be placed within a group ("division") of your peers. You will be responsible for reviewing their code and then voting on the best project for your division.

Please keep in mind that 33% of your score depends on the quality of what you write! I.e. giving other people better feedback === higher points for you!

Steps for a code review:

1. You will be placed within a group. The list will include links to pull requests.
1. For each pull request, review the code, and leave useful comments.
1. Watch this video on [how to perform code reviews on github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW0RPaJqm4g)
1. Useful comments end up scoring the most points. [See this helpful article for code review best practices.](https://leportella.com/review-code.html). 
1. Lastly (IMPORTANT), direct message Monarch Wadia with your vote. See [Voting](/guidebook/careerhack-hackathons/careerhack-scoring) guide!.
