  Answers to the most common questions asked during CareerHack events.

## This is my first hackathon. Any tips for a newbie?

There's no real need to prep, although you could if you wanted to. CareerHack is designed to be a very, very easy experience. It's perfect for hackathon newbies, but is also challenging for experienced attendees. 

However, time absolutely flies by and you don't get a lot of it to make an MVP/finished product. If you're going to use a framework like React or Angular, it is best to have your boilerplate setup and ready to go so you won't be spending your time chasing dev environment setup bugs.

(Thanks to [Kytra Murphree](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kytrascript) for helping answer this question)

To get a feeler of what our challenges are like take a look at our past problem-sets [here!](https://github.com/MintbeanHackathons)

## Should I set up a backend server boilerplate beforehand, to persist the data?

Not really needed.

All of the challenges can be completed with browser-only implementations. So you can definitely get by without any server or persistence. 

Having said that, if you want to build a fully-fleshed-out full-stack application, then sure.

But there are downsides. This is a design choice you're making BEFORE being presented with the problem set. And an inappropriate design choice could adversely affect your score during Code Quality assessment.

## It is necessary to register in EventBrite to participate or if we have previously participated, can we do it directly?

Please register on Eventbrite if there are seats :-) it helps us keep attendees at a mangeable level. The events are immensely popular, and we sell out more often than not. 

If the event is sold out, BUT you have already attended a previous event, please directly message Jennifer or Monarch in slack, and we can still let you in if there is room!

## What does the CareerHack schedule look like?

See the [CareerHack Hackathons](/guidebook/careerhack-hackathons) page for more information about the schedule.

## What is the Orientation session and how does it differ from the Introduction session?

The 12PM EDT (Toronto, Canada) Orientation is a MANDATORY session for first time Careerhackers. 

This half hour session is to give you time to read through the CareerHack Guide and instructions. In the guide you will be briefed on how the hacakthon process works, the rules, the requirements of the problem-set, and how to fork the repo from master (mandatory) to get started. It's also a time to ask any questions you may have on Discord :) 

After you done reading through the guide and you've asked all your questions, you may begin coding immediately! 

## When is the official start time to start coding?

The official start time for CareerHack and for coding is at 12:30PM EDT (Toronto, Canada).

## Can I start coding early? How early?

Yes! You absolutely can. If this is not your first rodeo, feel free to started immediately after you message in Discord that you're "starting"! 

You can get started as early as 12:00PM EDT (Toronto, Canada). This is how we reward our repeat participants!

## I could not finish coding on time, should I drop out?

Please don't! CareerHack is less about competition and more about the quality of code you wrote and overall a learning experience. Coding is only 33% of your grade, you can still perform outstandingly if you gave quality code review to your group mates!

Even if you don't finish the challenge you can still get feedback on the code you did write and from there you can learn how to improve yourself as well as learn how to work through the challenge by reviewing other people's work :)

## How exactly is CareerHack scored?

There are 3 equally-weighted portions:

- 33% Aesthetics - the look-and-feel of your implementation
- 33% Code Quality - how well written the code is, from a professional standards point of view
- 33% Code Review Performance - the usefulness and clarity of your comments on other people's code

For more information, please see the [Scoring](/guidebook/careerhack-hackathons/careerhack-scoring) page.

## How does Code Review work?

After the coding session ends at 3PM EDT (Toronto, Canada), Monarch (our dev host) will release a Code Review guide that will teach you how to properly do code review. 

This includes teaching you:

- Submitting your code: How to pull request from the master to allow everyone to see your work
- How to properly conduct code review on people's Github
- If there is a deploy section in the challenge - how to include a video link of your deployed project in your PR. This is will allow your group mates evaluate you on aesthetics which is 33% of your mark.

After you have submitted your code (aka pull requested) you will be put into groups of 4-5 and a Google Doc will be released on Discord at 3:30PM EDT (Toronto, Canada) to reveal your assigned groups. You **ONLY** review your group's code.  

## How is Code Review evaluated? Do other developers in my code review group score me?

Yes, other developers in your code review group will score you. 

 You will be  reviewing your group members' code in a **round robin format**. The winner from each division will be a runner-up and will be announced on social media. 

The winner will be picked by Monarch, and will receive a face-to-face 30 minute code review session! 

## Where can I signup for volunteering developer opportunities?

You can find the signup link in our slack channel under the name **"#volunteering-dev-opps".** 

But for your convenience, I will link it [here](https://airtable.com/shrso5ImW1eeSnaV5) too :D 

## How often do you host CareerHack?

We host CareerHacks **2x a week on Mondays and Wednesdays!** 

Register [here](https://bit.ly/35bMrVt) for our upcoming CareerHacks!

BUT, we have a new additional hackathon we host on Fridays as well! More info below!

## What is the Friday hackathon and how does it differ from the regular CareerHack?

Our Friday hacakthons is our **Mintbean Open Source Collaboration** project where we have opened up our Mintbean website platform to our community to offer a chance for developers to learn and work on open source. 

This is a collaborative hackathon that is ongoing **EVERY FRIDAY** **for 3 days.** It begins on Fridays at 12PM EDT (Toronto, Canada) and ends on Sunday at 12AM EDT (Toronto, Canada). 

This is beginner friendly as well as intermediate-advanced since there are different project issues of varying skill levels required that can be tackled. Check out the platform repo [here](https://github.com/MintbeanHackathons/MintbeanPlatform)!

## What are Mintbean Hiresides?

Mintbean Hiresides are 30 minute online webinar chats about anything in tech! Guests include TAs, recruiters, hiring managers, software developers & more.

They occur after every CareerHack on Mondays and Wednesdays at 4PM EDT (Toronto, Canada).  

If you are a registered CareerHack participant then you get a free spot to Hireside! The Zoom webinar link will be released in the Discord hackathon chat after CareerHack has ended :) 

## What is the minimum skill level requirement to participate in CareerHack/ Open Source?

The minimum level is 6months-1 year of coding knowledge and experience in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

But, whose really keeping track? You're the best judgement of your own skill level, so if you feel prepared enough to participate then we encourage you to do so! Even if you're hesitant to join, this is a great way to test yourself and see where your skill level is at compared to the industry standard! 

We don't judge in this community and we're here to support all devs of varying skill levels, even new learners too! Our hackathons are less about competition and completion and more about having fun and learning new things! Growth is what we value. 

So what are you waiting for? ;)
