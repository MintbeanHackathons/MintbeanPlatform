## I don't know Vue.js

Vue.js is one of the most popular frontend technologies, super intuitive and takes some of the best features from Angular and React. If you are not very familiar with this technology this is the opportunity to improve your skills. 

If you are experienced on other technologies such as React of Angular, to pickup the Vue.js components Idea it is not going to take you more than a tenth of working hours.

If you don't have much experience with JavaScript modern frameworks give it a try and you will be way more productive and capable of building amazing stuff.
